# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Atari-Game
Learning to play "Demon Attack" using Reinforcement Learning techniques

## Goal
Our mission is to develop an intelligent agent that learns to master [Demon Attack](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari/demon_attack/), a retro sci-fi shooter game where players defend Earth against relentless waves of alien demons. Through Reinforcement Learning, we're teaching our AI agent to adapt, strategize, and outperform human players by taking advantage of the game's dynamics.
